/// The whole of this corridor's meaning for BTCPay is in these two mappings, because BTCPay decides
/// whether an order is settled from the status alone. The rule below is deliberately conservative in
/// one direction and not the other: an invoice counts as paid only once the swap is
/// <see cref="ArkadeSwapIntentStatus.Fulfilled"/>, never merely funded. Calling a funded-but-unclaimed
/// swap paid would mark an order settled while the money still sits in a script we have not spent,
/// on a clock, with the counterparty's own reclaim path opening at the end of it.
